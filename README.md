# CurrencyConverter

This currency converting application uses C++, WinAPI and Winforms. You find out the conversion of all types of currency according to FX standards. 

Quick Note: The data isnt automatically pulled from their database (yet) so if any changes need to be made, you just need to update the .txt file and the calculations will be updated.
